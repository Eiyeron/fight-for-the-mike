My LDJam 41 compo entry

Fight against the top #1 band and set your *new*music genre (which actually is a mix-up of two old genres) as the best seller, for now...

This is only using the mouse.
You can select characters in your team (the blue pants one) with left click and move them with right click.
They'll automatically attack.
(They will act alone, but a bit of help is always welcome!)

Build with Haxeflixel. The 4.3 release should work out of the box. If not, commit `1d1d6b036da5deaf614de43e6e52f28c972ca4be` was the one I developped this game.

Note : I didn't bundle the source files for the music as it'd require the VST and stuff. I hope you'll understand.
